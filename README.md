# Santa-Game
This is a Christmas game built for fun in order to learn about game programming, and expand on my programming skillset in general.

-Collision (all entities have collision) ex. stone tiles, player, enemies, trees, etc

-Attack moves and animations (left punch, right snowball) both attacks have built in animations
